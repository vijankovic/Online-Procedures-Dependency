This repository contains the source code used for the simulations in the paper "Asymptotic online FWER control for dependent test statistics".
To reproduce the plots in the paper run the functions in main_simulation.R (Section 4.1) and main_simulation_platform.R (Section 4.2), respectively.
Additional results can be generated by passing the corresponding parameters to the functions.
